# InfinityBeans
Marathon infinity running on FullBeans? maybe.

Back in 1994 - ... I spent way too much time as a teenager playing Bungie's Marathon. In fact, I blame it as one of the reasons why I decided
to get a CS degree: I wanted to do _that_. Then I had to adult, get a real job (I did apply for a job at Bungie once, tho) and suddenly was too
busy doing all sorts of other things... Then around 2000, Bungie released the source code for Marathon2, I said to myself, NOW it's the chance
to learn how it all worked... silence... then again in 2011 they released the Marathon Infinity souce, NOW, do it NOW, I said to myself, so now
in the year of our lord 2025 (almost 26) I finally downloaded the source...

For that long I've been wanting to play with Marathon's source code and maybe _port_ it to run on a _modern_
computer "so I can learn how it worked". Now that I have [beans](https://github.com/alexrestrepo/full-beans) as a bare bones window/event/ui abstraction
I thought maybe it's the time to make it work? One problem is, I don't know how the original engine worked, and unfortunately
there is no ["Black Book"](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebb/index.html) equivalent, so I asked the AI overlords to come up
with a _Black Book_, using a ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) style and... well, you can read
the result in the Docs folder. I'll start my journey there (I am only planning to use AI for these docs), and hopefully have something that runs, so I can learn how
the original masterpiece worked. Or at least that's my plan.
