# InfinityBeans

Marathon Infinity running on Full Beans? Maybe.

---

Back in 1994, I spent way too much time as a teenager playing Bungie's Marathon. In fact, I blame it as one of the reasons I decided to get a CS degree: I wanted to do _that_. Then I had to adult, get a real job (I did apply at Bungie once, though), and suddenly I was too busy doing all sorts of other things...

Then around 2000, Bungie released the source code for Marathon 2. "NOW it's the chance to learn how it all worked," I said to myself... *silence*... Then again in 2011 they released the Marathon Infinity source. "NOW, do it NOW," I said to myself. So now, in the year of our lord 2025 (almost '26), I finally downloaded the source.

For that long I've been wanting to play with Marathon's source code and maybe _port_ it to run on a _modern_ computer, "so I can learn how it worked." Now that I have [Full Beans](https://github.com/alexrestrepo/full-beans) as a bare-bones window/event/UI abstraction, I thought maybe it's time to make it work?

One problem: I don't know how the original engine worked, and unfortunately there's no ["Black Book"](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebb/index.html) equivalent. So I asked the AI overlords to come up with a _Black Book_, using a ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) style and... well, you can read the result in the [Docs](Docs/) folder. I'll start my journey there (I'm only planning to use AI for these docs), and hopefully end up with something that runs—so I can finally learn how the original masterpiece worked.

Or at least that's my plan.
